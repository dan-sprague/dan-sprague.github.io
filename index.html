    <div class="about-content">
      <p>I am a computational biologist with R&D interests in statistical methods development for high throughput -omics data, as well as biological sequence to function modeling via NLP & language modeling. My approach to biological machine learning problems is to balance performance with biological correctness and interpretability to non-expert stakeholders. I have extensive experience in deep learning, GLMs, and Bayesian modeling and inference.</p>
